## Hello!

I am a Ph.D student at the Central European University's Doctoral School of Political Science, Public Policy and International Relations. Substantively, my research focuses on the political economy of climate and energy policy. More generally, I am interested in causal inference, applied economics and econometrics. 

I received a Master in Public Policy from the Hertie School of Governance in Berlin, and a BA in Political Science from the University of Bucharest. 

Here is my [Full CV]()https://dsps.ceu.edu/sites/pds.ceu.hu/files/profilephd/files/1403/cvsurdeahernea.pdf), and my [Research Summary](https://dsps.ceu.edu/people/vlad-surdea-hernea).
